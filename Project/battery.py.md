# Internal Code Documentation: Tello Drone Control (Snippet)

[TOC]

## 1. Introduction

This document details the functionality of a Python code snippet designed to interact with a Ryze Tello drone using the `djitellopy` library.  The snippet demonstrates basic connection and battery information retrieval.

## 2. Code Overview

The code utilizes the `djitellopy` library to establish a connection with a Tello drone and retrieve its battery level and current state.

```python
from djitellopy import Tello

tello = Tello()
tello.connect()

print("Battery : " + str(tello.get_battery()))
print("Battery : " + str(tello.get_current_state()))
```

## 3. Function Details

### 3.1 `tello = Tello()`

This line instantiates a `Tello` object from the `djitellopy` library. This object represents the connection to the Tello drone.  The constructor (`__init__`) within the `Tello` class likely handles initial setup tasks, potentially including default parameter settings and internal variable initialization.  No specific details on the algorithm within this constructor are available from the provided code snippet.

### 3.2 `tello.connect()`

This method establishes a connection to the Tello drone. The underlying implementation likely involves network communication (e.g., UDP) to locate and connect to the drone based on its network address.  The exact protocol and error handling mechanisms are not visible from the provided code. Success or failure of connection is implied, but not explicitly checked or handled in the provided snippet.

### 3.3 `tello.get_battery()`

This method retrieves the current battery percentage of the Tello drone.  The algorithm likely involves sending a request to the drone over the established connection (as defined in `tello.connect()`) and parsing the response received from the drone, which contains the battery level information.  The response parsing details are not visible in this snippet.

### 3.4 `tello.get_current_state()`

This method retrieves the current state of the Tello drone. This could include various parameters such as flight mode, battery level (possibly redundant with `get_battery()`), speed, and other sensor data.  The precise data included in the state and the method of obtaining it from the drone are not detailed in the provided code snippet.  The algorithm would likely involve sending a command to the drone and parsing the received response for the various state parameters.


## 4. Output

The code prints two lines to the console:

* **Line 1:** Displays the drone's battery percentage.
* **Line 2:** Displays a string representation of the drone's current state.  The exact format of this string is determined by the implementation of `tello.get_current_state()`, and not directly evident from the provided code.


## 5. Dependencies

The code requires the `djitellopy` library.  This library must be installed prior to running the code.  Installation instructions should be found in the `djitellopy` documentation.
