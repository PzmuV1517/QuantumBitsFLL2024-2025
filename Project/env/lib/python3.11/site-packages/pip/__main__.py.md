# Internal Code Documentation: `pip` Launcher Script

[TOC]

## 1. Introduction

This document details the functionality of the Python script responsible for launching the `pip` package installer.  The script's primary function is to correctly configure the Python environment before executing the core `pip` code. This ensures consistent behavior regardless of how `pip` is invoked (e.g., directly from a wheel file or via `python -m pip`).

## 2. Code Overview

The script primarily manipulates `sys.path`, which dictates Python's module search order.  It performs two key operations:

1. **Removes Current Working Directory from `sys.path`:** This prevents unintended usage of the current directory when executing `pip` commands like `install`, `freeze`, etc., especially when launched as `python -m pip <command>`.

2. **Adds Wheel Directory to `sys.path`:** If `pip` is run directly from a wheel file (e.g., `python pip-*.whl/pip install pip-*.whl`), this section dynamically adds the wheel's directory to `sys.path`.  This allows the script to correctly import the `pip` package located within the wheel.


## 3. Detailed Function Explanations

The script's logic is primarily implemented through conditional statements and direct manipulation of `sys.path`.  No complex functions or algorithms are employed.

### 3.1 Removing Current Working Directory

```python
if sys.path[0] in ("", os.getcwd()):
    sys.path.pop(0)
```

This code snippet checks if the first entry in `sys.path` is either an empty string or the current working directory (obtained using `os.getcwd()`). If so, `sys.path.pop(0)` removes this entry, thus preventing potential conflicts.  This is crucial for consistent `pip` behavior across different invocation methods.


### 3.2 Adding Wheel Directory to `sys.path`

```python
if __package__ == "":
    path = os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(__file__))
    sys.path.insert(0, path)
```

This section handles the case where `pip` is executed from a wheel file.  The condition `__package__ == ""` indicates this scenario. The following steps are then performed:

1. **Determine Wheel Path:** `__file__` provides the path to the current script (`pip/__main__.py`). `os.path.dirname()` is called twice to strip off the `__main__.py` and `pip` directory components, leaving only the root path of the wheel file.


2. **Add to `sys.path`:** `sys.path.insert(0, path)` adds the extracted wheel path to the beginning of `sys.path`, ensuring that the `pip` package within the wheel is given priority during import.


### 3.3 Main Execution

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    from pip._internal.cli.main import main as _main
    sys.exit(_main())
```

This section executes the core `pip` functionality.  If the script is run directly (not imported as a module), it imports the `main` function from `pip._internal.cli.main` and executes it. `sys.exit(_main())` ensures that the script exits with the return code of the `pip` command.

## 4.  Conclusion

This script provides a robust and reliable mechanism for launching the `pip` package installer.  Its concise design and clear logic ensure consistent behavior across various execution environments.  The careful manipulation of `sys.path` is key to resolving potential conflicts and ensuring correct package import resolution.
