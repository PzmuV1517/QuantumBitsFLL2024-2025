# Internal Documentation: `_distutils_hack` Override

[TOC]

## 1. Introduction

This document details the functionality and implementation of the code snippet that overrides the default behavior of Python's `distutils` module.  The core functionality is achieved through a single line:

```python
__import__('_distutils_hack').do_override()
```

## 2. Code Description

The code utilizes the `__import__` built-in function to dynamically import a module named `_distutils_hack`. This module is assumed to exist within the project's structure and provides a function called `do_override()`. The `do_override()` function is then executed.  This indirect approach suggests a mechanism for conditionally altering the behavior of `distutils` based on the implementation within `_distutils_hack`.

## 3.  `_distutils_hack` Module (Assumed Implementation)

While the provided code snippet does not reveal the internal workings of `_distutils_hack`, we can infer its purpose and potential implementation based on its name and the context of the override.

The module `_distutils_hack` likely contains modifications or patches to the standard `distutils` module.  The `do_override()` function is presumably responsible for applying these modifications, potentially by:

* **Monkey patching:** Directly altering attributes or methods of the `distutils` module at runtime.  This might involve replacing functions with custom versions, or adding new functionality.
* **Replacing functions with wrappers:**  Creating wrapper functions that extend or modify the behavior of existing `distutils` functions before calling the original function.
* **Conditional Logic:** Based on system environment variables, platform checks, or other factors, the module could determine which alterations to apply.

**Hypothetical `_distutils_hack.py` Example (Illustrative):**

```python
# _distutils_hack.py (Illustrative Example)

import distutils.command.build_ext

def do_override():
    """Overrides the build_ext command to use a custom compiler."""
    #Check if a custom compiler is configured
    if 'CUSTOM_COMPILER' in os.environ:
        #Replace the build_ext.build_extensions method
        distutils.command.build_ext.build_ext.build_extensions = custom_build_extensions

def custom_build_extensions(self, ext_modules):
    #Implementation of a custom build extensions
    #...
```

This example shows that `_distutils_hack` could modify the `build_ext` command of `distutils` to incorporate a custom compiler defined by the environment variable `CUSTOM_COMPILER`.  This is a possible, but not the only, scenario for the use of such a module.

## 4. Algorithm

The algorithm is straightforward:

1. **Import the module:** `__import__('_distutils_hack')` loads the `_distutils_hack` module into memory.
2. **Execute the override:**  The `do_override()` function within `_distutils_hack` is called. This function executes the specific logic to modify `distutils` behavior as implemented within `_distutils_hack` itself.


## 5.  Potential Issues

* **Dependency:** The code relies on the presence of the `_distutils_hack` module. If this module is missing or contains errors, the code will fail.
* **Side effects:**  Monkey patching can lead to unexpected side effects and make debugging more difficult.  Careful consideration should be given to potential conflicts with other modules or libraries.
* **Maintainability:** Dynamically altering modules can reduce code maintainability.  Proper documentation and testing are essential to minimize the risks associated with this technique.

## 6. Conclusion

The provided code snippet utilizes a dynamic import and function call to override the functionality of the `distutils` module, likely to provide platform-specific adjustments or custom build processes.  The exact behavior depends entirely on the implementation within the `_distutils_hack` module.  Careful review and understanding of this dependent module are necessary for complete comprehension.
